## Video: How Hong Kong film directors are navigating a new era of censorship

“Being in this era, you ought to tell the stories about this era,” says by Chan Tze-woon, director of Blue Island – an uncensored documentary that cannot be screened publicly in Hong Kong.

HKFP speaks to four film directors about navigating new red lines under Hong Kong’s security law. Whilst some now enjoy free expression abroad, others have opted to stay and believe the restrictions could give rise to more creativity.

Since Hong Kong’s legislature amended the Film Censorship Ordinance in 2021, enabling the government to ban films deemed contrary to national security from being screened, some directors have given up releasing their works in Hong Kong.

The film authorities told HKFP that a total of three films have been banned since 2021 thus far – the first film bans since the 1997 Handover. At least 14 films have reported trouble in applying for screening approval over the past two years, according to analysis by HKFP.
