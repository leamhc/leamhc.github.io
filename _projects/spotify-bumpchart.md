## The Story

I scrapped the 100 greatest artists of all time ranked by [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446) in 2010 and see if their songs are still popular in 2024 using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api). 

The artists below are ranked by Rolling Stone's list (left) and by their number of followers on Spotify (right).

## The Graph

Hip-hop has gained significant momentum over the past decade. Looking at the graph, it seems hip-hop artists are more widely recognised by fans than they were by music critics at the time.
