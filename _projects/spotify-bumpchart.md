## The Story

I scrapped the 100 greatest artists of all time ranked by [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446) in 2010 and see if their songs are still popular using the Spotify API. The artists below are ordered in their number of followers on the music platform. Apparantly, Eminem still got a fairly strong fan base.

## The Graph

To be fair, it's not just Eminem - hip-hop, in general, has been gaining a lot of momentum over the past decade. Perhaps the hip-hop stars are just recognized more by fans than by the music critics from the music magazine.
