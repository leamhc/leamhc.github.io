## The Story

I scraped the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, ranked by [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446) in 2010, to see if their songs are still popular in 2024 using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api).

The artists below are ranked by their number of followers on Spotify, with each rectangle representing one of their five most popular songs.

Surprisingly, Eminem still has a strong fan base on the platform.
