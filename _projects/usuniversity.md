## The Story

I scrapped the 100 greatest artists of all time ranked by [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446) in 2010 and see if their songs are still popular using the Spotify API. The artists below are ordered in their number of followers on the music platform. Apparantly, Eminem still got a fairly strong fan base.
