## The Story

Using R Selenium, I scraped the locations of all R1 doctoral universities (which have very high research activity) and plotted them on a map of the USA.

As shown in the graph, top universities are not evenly distributed across the country - most are concentrated on the East Coast and major cities, with far fewer in the Midwest.
