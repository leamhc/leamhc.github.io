## The Story

I scrapped the 100 greatest artists of all time ranked by [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446) in 2010. Here's a dumbbell showing the duration between the artists' first album and their latest one on Spotify - most of which are remastered versions.
